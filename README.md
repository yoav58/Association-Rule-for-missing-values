# Association Rule for missing values
In this project, I aimed to enhance machine learning predictions on a dataset by employing association rule algorithms for imputing missing values.


## File organization
There are four dataset folders, each folder containing two  approaches for handling missing values within the dataset:
-  The association rule method.
-  Traditional methods, such as using the mean for numerical attributes and the most common value for categorical attributes.

Furthermore, there are testing files in every folder that allow for the comparison of the model performanceÂ·


#### Notes
- Due to the slow processing speed of the Apriori algorithm, executing the test file may require a significant amount of time.
- Python version: 3.8
